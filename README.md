- âœ… Prepares an AppNotifier providing an minimal AppState using SharedPreferences 
- âœ… Provides a `ToolBarPullDownButton` in the `ToolBar` with two menu items
  * `Choose Folder` which opens a FilePicker
  * `Scan Directory`which calls a method on `AppNotifier`
- âœ… Reads the current version from the pubspec.yaml and provides it in the `AppState`
- âœ… Has these packages pre-installed
  * `macos_ui` 
  * `flutter_hooks`
  * `hooks_riverpod`

## Credits 
If you don't need or want Riverpod, preferences and file_picker, you can also use the brick `macosui_starter`, 
which was the starting point for this brick. 
It has less packages but allows multiple windows and has several options to configure the window style.
